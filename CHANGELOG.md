# Release Notes

## v2.0.0 - 2018-12-27

* Now maintained by [aussi](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/2431-aussi/)
* Now includes 46 libraries, up from 12. The latest list of supported libraries is [always available here](https://github.com/aussig/X-Plane-Backup-Library/tree/master/libraries) 
* Implemented a Python project to build the library automatically, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aussig/X-Plane-Backup-Library) for futureproofing against abandonware
* Placeholder path is now `placeholders/` rather than `opensceneryx/` to avoid confusion
* Exports to built-in X-Plane® library paths (e.g. lib/airport/aircraft) are excluded - these are virtual paths that X-Plane® uses for e.g. placing static aircraft and adding blank placeholders to them is not appropriate
